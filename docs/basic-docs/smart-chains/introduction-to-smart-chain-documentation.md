#### About Smart Chain Tutorials

The Smart Chain Tutorials section contains various tutorials that provide instruction in Smart Chain creation and usage.

For a walkthrough covering multiple tutorials in a targeted fashion, please see the [Learning Launchpad](../basic-docs/start-here/learning-launchpad/learning-path-outlines.html) section.

#### About Smart Chain API

The Smart Chain API section contains all available API commands for a default Smart Chain daemon.

These API commands can also be called Remote Procedure Calls, or RPCs. 

The API section does not include commands that are unique to Antara modules, as Antara modules are not active by default on a Smart Chain daemon. Please see the Antara section for further information.
