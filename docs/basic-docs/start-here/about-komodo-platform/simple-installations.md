# Simple Installations

## Smart Chain Installation

#### Installing Basic Komodo Software

To install the Komodo daemon, `komodod`, and its necessary counterpart, `komodo-cli`, the simplest method is to download pre-compiled binaries.

Downloadable packages are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

[Download and unzip the pre-compiled executables found here.](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases)

Once unzipped, the executables do not require installation. Simply find `komodod` and `komodo-cli` in the directory where you unzipped the files.

You may also build `komodod` and `komodo-cli` from source. This is not required, but it is considered the best practice. Building from source enables you to receive the latest patches and security upgrades the moment they are pushed to the `komodod` source.

#### See the Smart Chains Documentation for Further Details

Please see the full [Smart Chains]() technical documentation for full software explanations.

You will find [a walkthrough on building from source here.](https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/installation.html)
